# API Gateway Services 
Version: 1.0

This API Gateway Services serves as the central entry point for our microservices platform. Its primary
objectives include request routing, load balancing, security, and
simplifying client interactions with our backend services.

This API Gateway Services is a critical component of our
microservices architecture, responsible for directing incoming requests
from clients to the appropriate backend services while enforcing
security measures and providing a seamless user experience.

## Functionality:

-   **Request Routing:** The API Gateway routes incoming requests to the
    relevant microservices, such as product catalog, user
    authentication, and order processing.

-   **Load Balancing (v2):** It distributes traffic evenly among
    multiple instances of each microservice to ensure high availability
    and optimal performance.

-   **Security:** Our API Gateway implements JWT token authentication
    and authorization to protect sensitive data and services.

-   **Caching (v2):** To enhance performance, the API Gateway employs
    caching for frequently accessed product data.

-   **Rate Limiting:** We apply rate limiting to prevent abuse and
    maintain fair usage of our services.

**Supported APIs:**

-   Product Catalog API

-   User Authentication API

-   Order Processing API (v2)

-   Payment Gateway Integration (v2)

**Security Measures:**

-   Authentication: JWT token-based authentication with expiration and
    refresh tokens.

-   Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC) for protected
    endpoints.

-   API Key Validation: Additional layer of security for certain
    privileged APIs.

**Configuration (V2):**

-   Configuration is managed via Spring Cloud Config Server, allowing
    for dynamic updates without service restarts.

**Monitoring and Analytics (v2):**

-   Metrics and logs are collected using Prometheus and Grafana,
    providing real-time insights into API Gateway performance and
    request behavior.

**Error Handling:**

-   The API Gateway handles errors gracefully, providing informative
    error responses to clients.

**Scalability and Load Balancing (v2):**

-   Auto-scaling is configured for backend services to handle traffic
    spikes, and the API Gateway performs load balancing using Round
    Robin.

**Rate Limiting and Throttling (v2):**

-   Rate limiting is enforced for user authentication and order
    processing to ensure fair usage.

**Version History:**

-   1.0 (Current Version): Initial release with routing, load balancing,
    security, and caching capabilities.
